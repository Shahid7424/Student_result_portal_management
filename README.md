Convenient input of student exam scores and updating of records by teachers.
Automatic calculation of total marks, grades, and GPAs based on predefined grading criteria.
Generation of comprehensive reports for individual students, classes, or subjects.
User-friendly and intuitive graphical interface using Java Swing.
Technologies Used
The application is built using the following technologies:

**Java Swing:** For the graphical user interface (GUI).
Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit): For building GUI components.
Java JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): For database communication and management.
MySQL (or any other preferred database): For storing student and result data.
Other standard Java libraries and tools.
Installation
To run the Student Result Management System, follow these steps:

Clone or download the project from the repository.

**Set up the database:**

Install and configure MySQL (or any other preferred database).
Create a new database for the application.
Import the database schema and data from the provided SQL file.
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).

Configure the database connection:

Open the source code for the application.
Locate the database configuration file (e.g., DatabaseConfig.java).
Update the database connection settings (URL, username, password) to match your database.
Build and run the application:

Build the project in your IDE to compile the Java source code.
Run the application from the main class (e.g., MainApp.java).
The Student Result Management System application window should now open, and you can access the various features based on your user role (administrator, teacher, student).
